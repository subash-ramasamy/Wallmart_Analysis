# Walmart - Confidence Interval and CLT
Conducted comprehensive data analysis on walmart data, including structure examination, null value detection, and outlier identification in the dataset.
Explored and compared average spending patterns among 50 million female and male customers, to derive confidence intervals and provide actionable insights for Walmart's strategic decisions.

**Key Objectives:**

- Imported the dataset and analyzed its structure.
- Identified and handled null values; detected outliers using boxplots, "describe," and other methods.
- Explored spending per transaction for 50 million female and male customers; calculated and compared average expenses.
- Utilized sample averages to estimate population average spending; applied the Central Limit Theorem to compute confidence intervals; adjusted sample size to observe mean expense distribution.
- Explored different confidence interval widths of 95%; concluded results based on overlapping or non-overlapping intervals.
- Provided recommendations and action items for Walmart based on the analysis; assessed implications of overlapping confidence intervals.
- Extended analysis to compare spending between married and unmarried customers.
- Categorized age into bins and analyzed spending patterns across different life stages.
